SimpleDownload
==============

This project is an extension for [Joomla!](http://www.joomla.org/) that allows the
site admin to force the end user's browser to download files that normally would
automatically open up inside the browser (eg. PDF, MP3, JPG, etc).

There is an accompanying plugin called [plg_simpledownload](http://github.com/hjoelr/plg_simpledownload)
that automatically generates the links that are needed to direct the requests to
com_simpledownload.
